Hello and welcome to Count Me In for Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute!

 > > Contact us at countmein.setup@gmail.com to send and update your database for students or staff members (See (b))

(a) How it works:
    - Each staff member at your school has an account to manage the student involvement of their homeroom.
    - Staff can view all the events at the school, and take attendance for each
    - Students are allocated points based on their attendance
    - A Master Admin has an account to manage and create events, as well as generate a report to determine prize winners
    - The Master Admin can access the leaderboard with students and their points, and which can be communicated to students and increase engagement through creative ways



(b) Database guidelines:
    (i) To update staff members (users):
    Send us an Excel or Google Sheets downloaded in the format of a csv file with only the following for each account:
    - Column 1: Employee Numbers
    - Column 2: First Names
    - Column 3: Last Names
    - Column 4: Emails (for contact)
    - Column 5: Passwords
    - The first row contains the information for the Master Admin, a user that can manage the events and prizes

    (ii) To update students:
    Send us an Excel or Google Sheets downloaded in the format of a csv file with only the following for each student:

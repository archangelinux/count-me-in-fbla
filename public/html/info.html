            Hello and welcome to Count Me In for Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute! <br>
            <br>

            > > Contact us at <u>countmein.setup@gmail.com</u> to send and update your database for students or staff members
            (See (b))
            <br><br>
            (a) How it works:<br>
            - Each staff member at your school has an account to manage the student involvement of their homeroom.<br>
            - Staff can view all the events at the school, and take attendance for each<br>

            - Students are allocated points based on their attendance<br>

            - A Master Admin has an account to manage and create events, as well as generate a report to determine prize
            winners<br>
            - The Master Admin can access the leaderboard with students and their points, and which can be communicated
            <br> to students and increase engagement through creative ways<br>


            <br>
            (b) Database guidelines:<br>

            (i) To update staff members (users):<br>

            Send us an Excel or Google Sheets downloaded in the format of a csv file with only the following for each
            account:<br>

            - Column 1: Employee Numbers<br>

            - Column 2: First Names<br>

            - Column 3: Last Names<br>

            - Column 4: Emails (for contact)<br>

            - Column 5: Passwords<br>

            - The first row contains the information for the Master Admin, a user that can manage the events and
            prizes<br>
            <br>

            (ii) To update students:<br>

            Send us an Excel or Google Sheets downloaded in the format of a csv file with only the following for each
           student:<br>

            - Column 1: Student Numbers<br>

            - Column 2: First Names<br>

            - Column 3: Last Names<br>

            - Column 4: Grade<br>

            - Column 5: Employee Number of Homeroom Teacher (from staff member list)<br>

            - Column 6: Current Number of Points
